  Aquae - gov.uk Personal Data Exchange Specification
  ===================================================

  Copyright (C) 2017, The Personal Data Exchange Team, Crown Copyright (Government Digital Service).

1. Introduction

       gov.uk Personal Data Exchange is a way to query existing personal data
       held by government. This distribution is the technical specification
       for how the system operates and a set of tools for working with the
       messages and protocols defined.

       The whole package is distributed under an MIT license and as such is
       free to use and modify as long as you agree to its terms.

       Note: Should you have any trouble in setting up and using these tools,
       please feel free to contact:

       + Andy Bennett <andyjpb@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>
       + Simon Worthington <simon.worthington@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>

2. Specification

       The specification is described in the following files:

       + transport.md

           This file documents the low-level transport protocols used
           by participants in the system.

       + metadata.md

           This file documents the format and structure of the configuration
           file produced.

       + messaging.md

           This file documents the format and sequences of messages sent
           by participants in the system.


3. Installation

       The tools in this package can be run straight away; they do not need to
       be built or installed. However, they do have a number of dependencies
       which need to be satisfied.

       For UNIX systems, the tools require GNU Make and Perl. These tools are
       usually available by default or from system packages.

       For Windows systems, the tools require PowerShell, which is availble by
       default in Windows 10 or from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell.


4. Usage

       In order to render the specification and build the protocol and
       message definition, on UNIX invoke `make` thus:

           make all

       Or from PowerShell on Windows:

           .\build.ps1

       This will produce three files:

       + transport.proto

           This contains the Protocol Buffer definitions for the low-level
           transport protocols.

       + metadata.proto

           This contains the Protocol Buffer definitions for the metadata
           file that is used to set policy in a federation of Aquae nodes.

       + messaging.proto

           This contains the Protocol Buffer definitions for the inter-node
           messaging protocol.


5. Examples

       The scripts in the examples directory create Aquae Metadata files in
       Protobuf Text Format that describes an example Aquae Federation.

       These are synthetic examples for testing and may not represent real world entities or usage.
       
       Please consult examples/README.md for more information.

6. Compatibility notes

       This specification is not yet stable and, as such, we make no
       guarantees of backwards or forwards compatibility. We do not recommend
       that this system is deployed in anger.


7. What's next?

       First and foremost, enjoy the tools and use and extend them to build
       your own Personal Data Exchange Federations.

       Please feel free to send tools that you build with this so that they
       can be integrated and distributed with this package.

       Suggestions, extensions and patches are welcome.

       If you have any questions or problems (even the slightest problem, or
       the stupidest of questions), then please feel free to get in touch with
       us directly using the addresses above. We will try to help you, get you
       going or point you in the right direction.
